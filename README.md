CS 1331, good times. Good times.

At the very end of CS 1331, we were given a choice: We could make a graph visualizer for data, or we could make a fully fledged Tetris game. Wait, there was a choice? Anyways, here's that Tetris game.
The actual requirements of the project were to be able to rotate pieces, clear lines, and save and load the game. I took it so much further than that. Full graphics system, 60fps double buffered display instead of timers and swing components, sounds, music, wall kicks on rotations, piece ghosting, next pieces row, scoring, and difficulty ramping.

This shows the first pieces and steps towards the Gears engine, the display canvas, the simple state management, focus on sprites.

This was so much fun!
